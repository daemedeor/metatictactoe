# metatictactoe
  A meta version of tictactoe that is played via websockets and on node.js 

#How To Play

> Simply win the big board like you normally do. Get three in a row! 
> You win a square by winning the smaller tic tac toe game inside
> The catch is that when you play on the smaller tic tac toe, the opponent must play the indicated smaller tic tac toe.
> If the square is completed/unwinnable, then the opponent gets to choose whichever square that person wants to play on
